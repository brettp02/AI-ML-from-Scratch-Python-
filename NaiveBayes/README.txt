Before running make sure you have the correct libraries imported with the following command:

	- 'pip install numpy && pip install pandas'


To run the program enter the following command inside NaiveBayes directory:
	- 'python3 NaiveBayes.py breast-cancer-training.csv breast-cancer-test.csv'


As long as everything goes well the program should print the accuracy to the system and will create two .txt files which contain the relavent data. These are used for reference inside the report with 'probabilities.txt' being used for Q1 and 2, and 'test_output.txt' for Q3.
